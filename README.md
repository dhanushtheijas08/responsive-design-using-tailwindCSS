## About the Challenge

I created this project as a personal challenge to build mini web projects using Tailwind CSS. Each project builds upon my skills and knowledge in web development, and I hope they can serve as a helpful resource for others looking to learn or practice as well. Thank you for visiting, and I hope you find something interesting or useful in these projects!
